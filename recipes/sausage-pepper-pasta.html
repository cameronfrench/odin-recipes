<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 Italian sausage links (about Â½ lb.)</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
    <li>1 yellow onion</li>
    <li>1 24oz. jar pasta sauce</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp dried basil</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp crushed red pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 penne pasta</li>
    <li>1 oz. feta, crumbled</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium. Add the cooking oil and sausage links to the skillet and cook the sausage for a few minutes on each side, or until well browned (it does not need to be cooked through at this point).</li>
    <li>Remove the sausage to a clean cutting board and slice the sausage into medallions. Return the sausage to the skillet and continue to cook until the sausage is cooked through and browned on the cut sides. Remove the sausage to a clean plate.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, slice the bell pepper and onion into thin strips. Add the sliced onion and bell pepper to the skillet after removing the sausage. Stir and cook the vegetables over medium heat, just until they begin to soften slightly.</li>
    <li>Add the sausage back to the skillet along with the pasta sauce, basil, oregano, and red pepper to the skillet. Stir everything to combine and heat through.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil for the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and continue to boil until tender (about 7 minutes). Drain the pasta in a colander, then add it to the skillet and stir to combine with the sauce.</li>
    <li>Top the skillet with crumbled feta and chopped parsley (if desired), then serve.</li>
